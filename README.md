# Dooby

This is toy "database" (it's just a and in-memory map). I made in order to play around with the idea of transactions as a persistent data structure. A transaction here chains together reads and writes that can be checked for consistency with data in the DB at the time of the commit. If the data is not consistent, it means some value that the transaction has read is now out of date. In this case the logic that produced the transaction can be retried until its entire span is based on a consistent view of the data.
